                        <h>E-Commerce Cart System...</h>
                        <p>The E-Commerce Cart System is a web-based shopping application developed using Flask (Python) and SQLite to provide a seamless online shopping experience for users and efficient management for administrators. The project allows users to register, log in, browse products, add them to a shopping cart, update quantities, and proceed to checkout with ease. Secure authentication and password hashing ensure user data protection.
                        Administrators have access to a dedicated admin panel to manage users and products, including options to add, edit, or delete items, and control user privileges. The application features a clean, responsive interface built with HTML, CSS, and Jinja2 templates, delivering clarity and ease of navigation.
                            
                        The systemâ€™s modular architecture divides operations into key modules such as user management, cart operations, checkout processing, and product administration. It is lightweight, scalable, and easy to deploy, making it ideal for small to medium-sized online stores.
                            
                        This project demonstrates strong understanding of full-stack web development, database management, and secure web application design, showcasing the ability to build practical and functional e-commerce solutions from the ground up.</p>
